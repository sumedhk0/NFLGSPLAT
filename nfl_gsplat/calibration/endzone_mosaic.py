"""Register endzone frames into one reference frame and accumulate static paint.

The endzone camera is a fixed tripod: it pans/tilts/zooms but never translates.
With no translational parallax the frames are related EXACTLY by homographies
(measured 0.2-0.6 px on real footage), which is what makes this far more precise
than player correspondences (87 px at the true camera).

Registration is DIRECT frame->reference wherever possible. Direct links were
measured to hold across a whole play (36-47 inliers at a 420-frame gap), and
they cannot accumulate drift the way sequential chaining does (chaining drifted
6 px -> 282 px on real footage). A local-chain fallback covers frames whose
direct link is too weak.
